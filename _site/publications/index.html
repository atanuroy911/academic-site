            <p>Nowadays, the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has a wide application in transportation. For instance, by leveraging it, we are able to perform accurate and real-time vehicle speed detection in an IoT-based smart city. Although numerous vehicle speed estimation methods exist, most of them lack real-time detection in different situations and scenarios. To fill the gap, this paper introduces a novel low-altitude vehicle speed detector system using UAVs for remote sensing applications of smart cities, forging to increase traffic safety and security. To this aim, (1) we have found the best possible Raspberry PIâ€™s field of view (FOV) camera in indoor and outdoor scenarios by changing its height and degree. Then, (2) Mobile Net-SSD deep learning model parameters have been embedded in the PI4B processor of a physical car at different speeds. Finally, we implemented it in a real environment at the JXUST university intersection by changing the height (0.7 to 3 m) and the camera angle on the UAV. Specifically, this paper proposed an intelligent speed control system without the presence of real police that has been implemented on the edge node with the configuration of a PI4B and an Intel Neural Computing 2, along with the PI camera, which is armed with a Mobile Net-SSD deep learning model for the smart detection of vehicles and their speeds. The main purpose of this article is to propose the use of drones as a tool to detect the speeds of vehicles, especially in areas where it is not easy to access or install a fixed camera, in the context of future smart city traffic management and control.

            <p>After nearly 30 years of development, service robot technology has made important achievements in the interdisciplinary aspects of machinery, information, materials, control, medicine, etc. These robot types have different shapes, and mainly in some are shaped based on application. Till today various structure are proposed which for the better analysisâ€™s need to have the mathematical equation that can model the structure and later the behaviour of them after implementing the controlling strategy. The current paper discusses the various shape and applications of all available service robots and briefly summarizes the research progress of key points such as robot dynamics, robot types, and different dynamic models of the differential types of service robots. The current review study can be helpful as an initial node for all researchers in this topic and help them to have the better simulation and analyses. Besides the current research shows some application that can specify the service robot model over the application.</p>

            <p>SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) and DCS (Distributed Control System) are both famous terms in automation and they both have critical rules. There is rarely an industry in the world which are not auditing their outcome based on one of these terms. But IOT developed in recent years, mixing the functionality of these two terms has been going on too with various security challenges involved. Even some previous issues like the price of software and easy extendibility of them make the way for small industries to have their benefits. In this research paper along with the designing and comparison, two small SCADA systems for agricultural applications tries to reduce the size as well as address a zonal method to investigate the security problems.

            <p>Controlling a system can be done in various ways and methods. The classical method which even now a day as a solution works is PID which in that with some method three-parameter of controller called P (Proportional), I (Integral), D (Derivational) tuned to have the best controlling response from a system. The AGV robot as the abbreviation of the Automated Guided Vehicle is as a famous robot platform which used in various industries relies on PID controllers in various ways. Each AGV or Machine has its own set of function, hence, in order to accomplish the exact set of workload more efficiently one need to actually tune the PID parameters accordingly so that there cannot be an intolerable amount of energy loss, inefficiency rate, lag, lack of robustness etc. In this paper over than introduction of PID controller and see the effect of each parameter on the real system the compassion between hired methods on AGV robot are investigated. As this review indicates that various PID tune method are used based on system requirements with the help of Lyapunov Direct Method, traditional Ziegler Nichols, Fuzzy controller, human immune system called the humoral, neural network, etc to control the speed and steering of an AGV systems.</p>

Hence, it takes up a significant amount of energy and value in the form of money from respective organizations for both implementing a suitable system for manpower management as well as maintaining that same system. Although this amount of expenditure for big organizations is near to nothing, rather just a formality, it does not hold as much truth for small organizations such as schools, colleges, and even universities to a certain degree. This is the first point. The second point for discussion is that much work has been done to solve this issue. Various technologies like biometrics, radio-frequency identification, Bluetooth, global positioning system, quick response code, etc., have been used to tackle the issues of attendance collection.

            <p>The term telemedicine was first used in the 1920s, although used many years ago and has continued to evolve today. Medical diagnoses usually require visual information, but remote display systems have recently become a special place due to the constant unavailability of the treating physician or the remoteness of medical centers and the constant need of some patients for round-the-clock care. In this article, an Arduino-based heart rate information system is designed and implemented. Due to the reasonable price and easy accessibility of the created system in the fraction, it has many applications. The results of the designed system showed the system's capabilities to track and know the person's heart rate.</p>

        We extend the definition of the classic instantaneous vector field saddles, sinks, and sources to the finite-time setting by categorizing the domain based on the behavior of the flow map w.r.t. contraction or expansion. Since the intuitive Lagrangian approach turns out to be unusable in practice because it requires advection in unstable regions, we provide an alternative, sufficient criterion that can be computed in a robust way. We show that both definitions are objective, relate them to existing approaches, and show how the generalized critical points and their separatrices can be visualized.
